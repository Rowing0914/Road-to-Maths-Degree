### Algebra

[Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra) includes the study of algebraic structures, which are sets and operations defined on these sets satisfying certain axioms. The field of algebra is further divided according to which structure is studied; for instance, group theory concerns an algebraic structure called *group*.

### Calculus and analysis

[Fourier series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series) approximation of square wave in five steps.

[Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus) studies the computation of limits, derivatives, and integrals of functions of real numbers, and in particular studies instantaneous rates of change. [Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis) evolved from calculus.

### Geometry and topology

[Ford circles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_circle)—A circle rests upon each fraction in lowest terms. Each touches its neighbours without crossing.

[Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry) is initially the study of spatial figures like circles and cubes, though it has been generalised considerably. [Topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology) developed from geometry; it looks at those properties that do not change even when the figures are deformed by stretching and bending, like dimension.

### Combinatorics

[Combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics) concerns the study of [discrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set) (and usually [finite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_set)) objects. Aspects include "counting" the objects satisfying certain criteria (*[enumerative combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerative_combinatorics)*), deciding when the criteria can be met, and constructing and analyzing objects meeting the criteria (as in *[combinatorial designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_design) and [matroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroid) theory*), finding "largest", "smallest", or "optimal" objects (*[extremal combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremal_combinatorics)* and *[combinatorial optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization)*), and finding [algebraic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra) structures these objects may have (*[algebraic combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_combinatorics)*).

### Logic

[Venn diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram) are illustrations of set theoretical, mathematical or logical relationships.

[Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic) is the foundation which underlies [mathematical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic) and the rest of mathematics. It tries to formalise valid reasoning. In particular, it attempts to define what constitutes a proof.

### Number theory

The branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, especially the positive integers. [Number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory) is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and integer-valued functions. German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss said, "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences—and number theory is the queen of mathematics." Number theory also studies the natural, or whole, numbers. One of the central concepts in number theory is that of the [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number), and there are many questions about primes that appear simple but whose resolution continues to elude mathematicians.
