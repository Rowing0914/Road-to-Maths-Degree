## How to read maths papers

- [The Three Pass Approach](http://blizzard.cs.uwaterloo.ca/keshav/home/Papers/data/07/paper-reading.pdf)

- [How to skim through a paper to see if it's worth of taking time to read!](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-read-a-math-research-paper)

  This is the process I use to read a paper, every step is designed to get a little more information about whether the paper contains anything that makes it worth spending my time on, before I actually read the paper itself.

  1) The title - does it look like something interesting?
  2) The authors - are they people that you know do stuff you're interested in?
  3) The abstract - are you interested in the results described?
  4) The references - do they cite papers that you've previously read?
  5) Statements of theorems - do you understand what the results are?
  6) Introduction - check for definitions that may not be standard
  7) Statements of theorems again - do you understand them now you've read the introduction?
  8) If you get to this stage and you still want to read the paper then actually read it properly.
